# GitHub User Search Web App

This web application allows users to search for GitHub users and view their basic information along with their public repositories.

## How It Works

1. **Input Field**: Users can enter the GitHub username they want to search for.
2. **Search Button**: Clicking the "Search" button triggers an API request to fetch the user's information from GitHub.
3. **User Information**: Upon successful retrieval of user data, the application displays the user's avatar, username, GitHub profile link, and the number of public repositories.
4. **Repository Dropdown**: Users can click on the "Repositories" button to expand a dropdown menu showing the user's public repositories with links to each repository.
5. **Error Handling**: If the user does not exist or there's an issue with the API request, an error message is displayed to the user.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Materialize CSS)
- JavaScript (with Fetch API)
- GitHub API

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enter a GitHub username in the input field and click the "Search" button.
4. View the user's information and repositories.
